SFU-RecentChanges
-----------------
2015:
. Create /etc/sssd directory
. On RHEL, use authconfig to enable sss in nsswitch.conf
. Support for automounts served from Active Directory _without_ Server for NIS
. New parameters: autofs debug level, ldap_use_tokengroups, access_provider, ldap_acess_filter
. CentOS 6.6 dropped the package called libsss_autofs without warning so we no longer install it

Tested on CentOS 6 and 7. No support for CentOS 5.

Ubuntu/Debian: tested on 12.x. autofs support requires this stupid patch:
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/linuxmint/+bug/1081489

.. and early releases of 13 even required libsss_autofs.so to live in the root directory. I am not making this up.


2013:
. Support for Red Hat systems (CentOS 5+, Fedora 17+)
. Removed LDAP/TLS support, added LDAP/SASL support
. Extra Kerberos and LDAP parameters
. Red Hat systems: SSSD/nsswitch hooks for using LDAP/AD-provided automounts

Current Limitations
-------------------
. Assumes you've already joined the computer to AD (see https://github.com/sfu-rcg/puppet-adcli)
. Assumes you want SASL binding, not TLS
